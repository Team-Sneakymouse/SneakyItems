# SneakyItems

TODO: describe what SneakyItems does.

## Usage

Run `/sneakyitems reload` in-game or `sneakyitems reload` from the console to re-read `plugins/SneakyItems/config.yml`.
The permission is `sneakyitems.command.reload` (default: operators).

## Development

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build, unit tests and publish preflight | `./gradlew check` |
| Local Paper server | `./gradlew runServer` |

Builds need a git checkout with at least one commit: the version is `yyyy.MM.dd-<12-char-git-hash>` of `HEAD`.
Build output goes to `~/.cache/SneakyItems-gradle-build`, which keeps Gradle off slow FUSE/NTFS checkouts.
Coding agents follow [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Publishing

Every push to `main` publishes `io.github.team-sneakymouse:sneakyitems:<version>` to `https://maven.sneakyrp.com/releases`
through the shared [`Team-Sneakymouse/ci`](https://github.com/Team-Sneakymouse/ci) workflow
(`.github/workflows/publish.yml`). The repository must be allowlisted for Infisical OIDC; private repositories
also need the `INFISICAL_IDENTITY_ID` and `INFISICAL_DOMAIN` secrets.
